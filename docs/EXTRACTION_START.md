# 🚀 Realm Extraction Started

## Current Status

✅ Phase 1 Complete (Repository Foundation)
- Repository structure created
- Professional README written
- Logo design guidelines created
- realm-core extracted and building

🔄 Phase 2 In Progress (Core Components)
- realm-core: ✅ BUILDING
- Next: Extract model architecture
- Next: Extract backends
- Next: Integration testing

## Extraction Summary

From wasm-chord experiments, we have:
- ✅ Proven Candle backends (produces "Paris")
- ✅ Memory64 infrastructure
- ✅ WASM orchestration (stubs)
- ✅ Multi-backend support (CPU, CUDA, Metal)

## Next Session Goals

1. Continue Phase 2 extraction
2. Extract model architecture (transformer layers)
3. Extract compute backends
4. Build integration test
5. Verify "Paris" generation

## Estimated Completion

- Current: ~15% complete
- Target: 100% in 8-12 days
- Next session: Extend Phase 2, start Phase 3
