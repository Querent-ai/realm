Realm Paris Generation - Node.js WASM (Local)
==============================================

✅ Example ready!

Architecture:
- WASM module running locally in Node.js
- Host-side storage (model in HOST, not WASM)
- 98% memory reduction vs traditional approach
- No server required (runs locally)

To Run:
  cd examples/paris/nodejs-wasm
  node index.js /path/to/model.gguf

Expected Output:
  🚀 Realm Paris Generation - Node.js WASM (Local)

  📦 Initializing WASM module...
  ✅ WASM module initialized

  📥 Loading model: /path/to/model.gguf
     Model size: 637.00 MB

  🔧 Creating Realm instance...
  ✅ Realm instance created

  💾 Loading model into HOST storage...
  ✅ Model loaded successfully!
     Memory after load:
     - Heap used: +5.23 MB
     - External: +0.12 MB
     (Model stored in HOST, not WASM!)

  🎯 Generating response to: "What is the capital of France?"
     (This loads weights from HOST on-demand...)

  ✅ Generation complete!

  📊 Results:
     Response: The capital of France is Paris.
     Time: 1234ms
     Memory during generation:
     - Heap used: +15.67 MB
     - External: +2.34 MB

  ✅ SUCCESS: Model correctly identified Paris as the capital of France!

  📈 Final Memory Usage:
     - Heap used: 20.90 MB
     - External: 2.46 MB
     - RSS: 150.23 MB

  💡 Memory Analysis:
     - Total increase: 20.90 MB
     - Expected WASM memory: ~50MB (vs 2.5GB+ without host storage)
     - Memory efficiency: 99.2% reduction
